In addition; I wanted to dedicate this project to my mother; who raised a young boy without the traditional support
of mothers nowadays, in a rough world.  Mother, I'll love you always.  My sons, Miles and Logan;
they inspire my growth as a programmer and as a man, every day. Logan, you make me question how out of the box,
I could ever be.. with your agile and magical mind.. you are so worried about control that we will never have in the most 
firm of contexts.  Miles, I love your rejection of rules.  As if you could change the world with only intention.  
You deny the power of any system, just by the force of your personality.  I see your beliefs in my own life.

And of course.. Kelly; the most wonderful woman that has ever touched my life.  

I'll do anything.. anything to have you in my life when I wake.

Truth be told to add any methods on to this project, well it doesn't take long, perhaps 10-15 minutes of my life, 
but it all started because of Youth Impact.  http://youthimpactazure.websites.net.  They let me build for them,
without judging me, or my life at that point.  My weaknesses.  They allowed me to learn so much at their own cost,
because they had no one else that would help them.  I was at a horrible place.  Divorce.  My boys.  I missed them
so much, in a lot of ways I still do, because of the way this country works in regards to father's rights,
but I'll be here.. when you are ready.
